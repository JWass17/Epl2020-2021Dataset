This study involved doing an exploratory investigation to see whether player performance can be impacted by age. I started the project as a way to practice data analysis techniques, from importing the data set to data visualization. I also used the chance to learn about supervised learning methods like regression and how they function. The project was definitive, and I was able to identify my limitations and draw conclusions from it and provide recommendations.
